# euclideanAssigment
Assignment task in the 'CyberStart' program, a collaboration between 'Kodluyoruz' and 'IBM'. 

Steps:

1-Defining Points:
Create a list called 'points'. This list should contain tuples representing points in 2D space. For example, the point '(x, y)' will be represented as a tuple '(x, y)'.

2-Writing a Function for Euclidean Distance:
Define a function called 'euclideanDistance'. This function should take two tuples (each representing a point) and return the Euclidean distance between these two points.

3-Calculating Distances:
Using a loop, calculate the Euclidean distance between each pair of points in the 'points' list. Store these distances in another list called 'distances'.

4-Finding the Minimum Distance:
Find the minimum distance from the 'distances' list and print it.


Task Note: If you want a more challenging task, you can do it without using any libraries or modules.
